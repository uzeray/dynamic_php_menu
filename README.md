that example about an dynamic PHP and Mysqli Menu creating
you can see al the explaintation on over code blocks, in this example I used just two
if statemnt to draw an drop down - responsive and simple menu/navbar.

we see that on other dynamic menu examples are so complicated maybe there is more mean about
security or something else, but in this example completly will cover your necessaries,
if you use an bootstrap ready navbar even you can create dynamic menu just two if statement, most
important things is how to design to Table on database, than you can handle and draw menu bar how
you want, also you can use CSS or SCSS desing to your navbar there is no sense about design totally,

please first start to read sql_README.txt and sql_table.png,
after that you can see to index.php after that you can see header.php and all of important codes are here
lastly you can see .htaccess and customJquery.js pages to additional things.
